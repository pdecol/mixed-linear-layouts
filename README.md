# A collection of various functions for mixed linear layouts of graphs

written in Python 3.6


## Some examples

Show all 2-stack 1-queue layouts of a complete graph with 8 vertices (K8):
```
mll.py observation_1
```

Two K8 can interleave only once on a 2-stack 1-queue layout:
```
mll.py observation_2
```

If two K8 share two vertices then only one order is possible:
```
mll.py observation_3
```
